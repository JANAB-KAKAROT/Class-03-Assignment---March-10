# Python Assignment - Lessons 05, 06, and 07 🐍📚

## Overview 🌟
Hey there! 👋 This repository contains my **Python Assignment** covering **Lessons 05, 06, and 07**. These lessons focus on important Python concepts like **Control Flow, Loops, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Frozensets**, and **Dictionaries**. 

I know I’m a bit late 🕑 but I hope you still enjoy and learn from these examples! 🙌

## What’s Inside? 📂
- **Lesson 05**: **Control Flow & Loops** (if, elif, else, loops)
- **Lesson 06**: **Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries** (Lists, Tuples, Iterating, Common Methods)
- **Lesson 07**: **Sets & Frozensets** (Set operations, Frozensets)

## Concepts Covered 🧠
### Lesson 05: Control Flow & Loops 🔄
- **Conditional Statements**: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of a program.
- **Loops**: Using `for` and `while` to repeat tasks.
- **Simple Calculator**: A simple example to understand how operations can be performed.
  
### Lesson 06: Working with Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries 📝
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of elements.
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences of elements.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval.
- **Common Methods**: How to modify and access list elements, and iterate over lists.

### Lesson 07: Sets & Frozensets 🔒
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements.
- **Frozensets**: Immutable versions of sets.
- **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference, etc.

## How to Use This Assignment 🧑‍💻
