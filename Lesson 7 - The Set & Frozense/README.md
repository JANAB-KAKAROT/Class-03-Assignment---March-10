# Python Assignment - Lesson 07: Sets & Frozensets

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for **Lesson 07: Sets & Frozensets**. It demonstrates how to work with **sets** and **frozensets** in Python. The examples cover basic operations such as adding, removing, and performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## Files Included
- **lesson_07.py**: Contains Python code examples for sets and frozensets.

## Concepts Covered
### 1. **Sets in Python**:
   - Unordered collections of unique elements.
   - Adding, removing, and checking elements in a set.
   - Set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

### 2. **Frozensets in Python**:
   - Immutable version of a set.
   - The difference between sets and frozensets.
   - When to use frozensets for immutable set behavior.

### 3. **Common Set Operations**:
   - Set methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `discard()`, and `pop()`.
   - Mathematical set operations: union (`|`), intersection (`&`), difference (`-`), and symmetric difference (`^`).

## How to Run
